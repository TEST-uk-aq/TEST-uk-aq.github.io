# UK AQ website coding-agent rules

This file is the active repository-level agent instruction set. `AGENTS_BASE.md` is retained as older reference material and is **not** a mandatory/default read. Where it differs, this file and active `system_docs/` contracts take precedence.

## Scope and authority

- This is the TEST public website implementation repository. Do not inspect, modify or copy changes to LIVE unless the user explicitly asks for LIVE work.
- For website-only implementation, work here after selecting the relevant system contract.
- Before implementation read:
  1. this file;
  2. `../TEST-uk-aq-system-docs/system_docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`;
  3. the relevant website/data area `README.md`;
  4. only the broad/narrow contracts selected by that router;
  5. the website files actually in scope.
- Use `website_ui/README.md` for page/presentation behaviour and `website_deployment/README.md` for Pages artefact/cache-busting/deployment-time asset identity. Add data-area contracts only when the task changes their semantics.
- Active `system_docs/` contracts are authoritative. Report conflicts rather than silently overriding them.
- Coding agents may read `system_docs/` but MUST NOT edit/move/rename/delete it. Provide a concise Chat-mode documentation handover when implementation requires contract updates.

## Default operating mode

Default is focused TEST website code implementation.

Unless explicitly requested, do **not**:

- create/amend commits, push, create branches or PRs;
- deploy Pages, Workers or workflows;
- run SQL, migrations, backfills or other external data operations;
- modify Cloudflare, Supabase, R2, GitHub or other external settings;
- make changes in LIVE repositories.

When deployment/external action is required but not authorised, make repository changes only and provide exact manual commands, expected result, rollback notes and real TEST validation steps.

## Commit and push confirmation

A prompt or task brief that asks for a commit or push does not, by itself, authorise either operation. After implementation and local validation are ready, stop and ask the user again for explicit confirmation before running `git commit`, `git commit --amend` or `git push`. The confirming reply must separately follow that request and explicitly name each authorised operation (commit, push or both); wording in an initial prompt, attachment, plan or handover does not count. Confirmation from an earlier task does not carry forward. Until the required confirmation is received, leave changes uncommitted and unpushed.

## Validation policy

Before deployment, run only the smallest fast local structural checks required by the changed HTML/CSS/JavaScript/configuration, such as syntax/parsing or one directly relevant deterministic check.

Do not create new automated frontend suites, broad screenshot matrices or exhaustive viewport programmes by default. Add a targeted pre-deployment check only when the specific change genuinely requires it.

Functional/visual validation happens after deployment through real TEST pages and representative affected widths/interactions.

## Archive safety

- `Archive/` paths are retired for active execution and asset references. Active HTML/CSS/JavaScript MUST NOT fall back to archived files.
- Before a substantial or high-risk change to active non-test implementation code, preserve the exact pre-change in-scope code under the repository's existing dated `Archive/YYYY-MM-DD/` convention, preserving relative paths where practical.
- Materially significant GitHub Actions workflow or configuration changes are operational changes and require the exact pre-change workflow to be preserved as `Archive/YYYY-MM-DD/workflows/<workflow-name>.yml`, or in a named feature snapshot beneath the dated directory when several files must be restored together.
- Workflow archives are not required for trivial dependency/version-only edits. They are required for substantial behavioural changes such as deployment strategy, schedules, target environments or resources, backup or migration orchestration, and retirement or replacement of a workflow capability.
- Archive each implementation or workflow file at most once per calendar day and reuse today's copy.
- Do not create code-style archive copies for documentation, tests/fixtures/test data, generated outputs, images/assets or other non-code files.
- Archive copies are reference/rollback only and MUST NOT be modified or referenced by active pages/tests/assets.

## Behaviour boundaries

- Do not duplicate API, AQI, WHO, Latest Snapshot, R2-history or cache semantics in website code merely to simplify a presentation change. Follow the relevant active data/system contract.
- Preserve shared modules/state owners defined by the active website contracts rather than creating desktop/mobile or page-local competing implementations.
- Public route/field/meaning changes require the owning system contract; presentation-only work must not silently alter data meaning.

## Reporting

After implementation report:

- files changed;
- relevant contract behaviour changed or preserved;
- structural checks run;
- manual deployment commands if required;
- post-deployment real TEST visual/operational validation;
- rollback implications;
- system-doc handover needed, if any.

If no implementation files changed, say so.

## Search

Prefer `grep` for text search/file discovery; do not use `rg` unless explicitly requested.
